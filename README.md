#   ***weekly project***
this project is basically my first mini-project given by #unlox academy 
i used conditional statements and the numpy function
it was fun doing this
this project is used for analyzing the students marks
it finds the total marks
the avg marks
the highest marks a student got
and the lowest marks a student got
also the marks are stored in an array
it is simple to use.
